# S M Sakif Shahriyar

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a **Lecturer in Civil Engineering** at **Uttara University**, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am currently pursuing a **Masterâ€™s in Transportation Engineering** from **Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)**.

I am passionate about combining **engineering** with **data science** and **software development** to solve real-world problems. My goal is to pursue further academic opportunities abroad through scholarships and explore advanced roles in universities or research organizations.

This repository serves as a portfolio of my academic work, projects, publications, and achievements. Here you will find details about my key projects, including the **Exam Management System** I developed for Uttara University, as well as links to my publications and professional experiences.
